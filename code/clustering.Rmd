## Overview

So the idea here is that we are going group NBA players into like group using a clustering algorithm The data is scraped from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2023_per_game.html)

Lets take a look at our data.

```{r head, echo=FALSE}
df %>% head()
```

First we need to decide what columns to keep

```{r dictionary, include=FALSE}
keep <- c("player", "pos", "age", "g", "gs", "mp", "fg", "fga",
          "x3p", "x3pa", "x2p", "x2pa", "ft", "fta", "orb", "drb",
          "ast", "stl", "blk", "tov", "pts")

df <- df %>% select(all_of(keep))
```

```{r peak, echo=FALSE}
df %>% head()
```

Next we need to encode some of these categorical values.

```{r encode, echo=FALSE, warning=TRUE}
df <- df %>%  
  recipe(~ . ) %>% 
  step_dummy(pos, one_hot = TRUE) %>% 
  prep() %>% 
  bake(df)
  
```

Now let's take a look at what the distribution of the stats look like overall

```{r all_stats, echo=FALSE}
mdf %>% 
  pivot_longer(where(is.numeric), names_to = "stat") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(pos, value, fill = pos)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.4) +
  theme_classic() +
  facet_wrap(~stat, scales = "free")

```

There are some outliers here for sure but lets roll with the data as is.

Before we model with 5 clusters (the same amount of positions on an NBA team) Lets look at the position counts as it stands today.

```{r echo=FALSE}
sdf %>% 
  group_by(pos) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n, pos, fill = pos)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_classic()
```

```{r five_model, echo=FALSE}
five_model <- df %>% 
  select(-player) %>% 
  kmeans(centers = 5)
# summary(five_model)

tidy(five_model) %>% print()
```

Let's take a look at the amount of players in each of the different clusters.

```{r echo=FALSE}
df$clus_5 <- five_model$cluster
df$clus_5 <- df$clus_5 %>% as.character()

df %>% 
  group_by(clus_5) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n, clus_5, fill = clus_5)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_classic()

df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(pts, ast, color = clus_5)) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_classic()

  
```

Now let's take a looks at how each cluster stacks up against each other for every stat.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# df %>% 
#   group_by(clus_5) %>%
#   pivot_longer(where(is.numeric)) %>% 
#   ggplot(aes(value, fill = clus_5)) +
#   geom_density() +
#   theme_classic() +
#   facet_wrap(vars(clus_5, name), ncol = 1)

for (col in colnames(df[,2:20])) {
  # print(col)
  df$Y <- df[col] %>% unlist()
  gg_tmp <- df %>% 
    ggplot(aes(Y, fill = clus_5)) +
    geom_density() +
    theme_classic() +
    xlab(col)
  print(gg_tmp)
}
df %>% select(-Y)
```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
pct <- function(x){
  x/sum(x)
}
 
df %>%
  select(-c(pos_C:pos_SG, Y)) %>% 
  group_by(clus_5) %>%
  summarise_if(is.numeric, sum) %>% 
  summarise_if(is.numeric, pct) %>% 
  round(2) 


```


So it looks like our model has separated the players on skill. We'll notice that the

- Red group (1) are the top players.  
- Blue group (4) are the next best players
- Green group (3) are likely role players 
- Yellow group (2) are the lower tier players
- Pink group (5) are likely young players and lower tier palyers.

Now that I've made the claim let me try and back it up.

### Pink Group - 5

```{r}
df |> 
  filter(clus_5 == "5") |> 
  summarise(
    centers = sum(pos_C),
    power_forwards = sum(pos_PF),
    small_forwards = sum(pos_SF),
    shooting_guards = sum(pos_SG),
    point_guards = sum(pos_PG)
  )
```
A lot of shooting guards in this group but then again there are more shooting guards in the league than anything else as we saw above.

I called this group either 1 of 2 things.  Lower Tier players or younger players. So let's take a look at the general ages of the players. 
```{r echo=FALSE}
pink <- df |> 
  filter(clus_5 == "5")

df |> 
  ggplot(aes(clus_5, age, fill = clus_5)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_classic()

df |> 
  group_by(clus_5) |> 
  select(age) |> 
  summarise(
    average_age = round(mean(age), 2),
    oldest = max(age),
    youngest = min(age),
    median_age = median(age)
  )

df |> 
  ggplot(aes(age, fill = clus_5)) +
  geom_density() +
  facet_wrap(~clus_5, ncol = 1) +
  theme_classic()

```

So I think we can see that the pink group is the youngest of the 5 groups.  So now let's see the minutes played and games started from each of groups.  We expect the Pink group to have noticably less than the other groups.

```{r echo=FALSE}
df |> 
  ggplot(aes(clus_5, mp, fill = clus_5)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 4 ) +
  theme_classic()

```

Bingo looks like we got quite a few end of the bench guys.  
They're also averaging less than a start and only have `r sum(subset(df, clus_5 == '5')$gs)` starts between them.  

```{r echo=FALSE}
df |> 
  group_by(clus_5) |> 
  summarise(
    mean_starts = round(mean(gs), 2),
    total_starts = sum(gs)
  )


```


So who are some the players in Group 5?

```{r echo=FALSE}
rbind(
df |> 
  filter(clus_5 == 5) |> 
  slice_max(age, n = 1) |> 
  mutate( Fact = "Oldest", reb = orb+drb),                                 

df |> 
  filter(clus_5 == 5) |> 
  slice_min(age, n = 1) |> 
  mutate( Fact = "Youngest", reb = orb+drb),

df |> 
  filter(clus_5 == 5) |> 
  slice_max(pts, n = 1) |> 
  mutate( Fact = "Top Scorer", reb = orb+drb),

df |> 
  filter(clus_5 == 5) |> 
  slice_max(ast, n = 1) |> 
  mutate( Fact = "Assist Leader", reb = orb+drb),

df |> 
  filter(clus_5 == 5) |> 
  slice_max(orb+drb, n = 1) |> 
  mutate( Fact = "Most Rebounds", reb = orb+drb),

df |> 
  filter(clus_5 == 5) |> 
  slice_max(stl, n = 1) |> 
  mutate( Fact = "Most Steals", reb = orb+drb),

df |> 
  filter(clus_5 == 5) |> 
  slice_max(blk, n = 1) |> 
  mutate( Fact = "Most Blocks", reb = orb+drb)
) |> 
  select(
    Fact,
    age, pts, ast, reb, stl, blk
  ) |> 
  arrange(Fact)

```
