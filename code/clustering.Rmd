## Overview

So the idea here is that we are going group NBA players into like group using a clustering algorithm The data is scraped from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2023_per_game.html)

Lets take a look at our data.

```{r head, echo=FALSE}
df %>% head()
```

First we need to decide what columns to keep

```{r dictionary, include=FALSE}
keep <- c("player", "pos", "age", "g", "gs", "mp", "fg", "fga",
          "x3p", "x3pa", "x2p", "x2pa", "ft", "fta", "orb", "drb",
          "ast", "stl", "blk", "tov", "pts")

df <- df %>% select(all_of(keep))
```

```{r peak, echo=FALSE}
df %>% 
  head() |> 
  kable(booktabs = TRUE) |> 
  kable_styling(font_size = 8)

```

Next we need to encode some of these categorical values.

```{r encode, echo=FALSE, warning=TRUE}
df <- df %>%  
  recipe(~ . ) %>% 
  step_dummy(pos, one_hot = TRUE) %>% 
  prep() %>% 
  bake(df)
  
```

Now let's take a look at what the distribution of the stats look like overall

```{r all_stats, echo=FALSE}
mdf %>% 
  pivot_longer(where(is.numeric), names_to = "stat") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(pos, value, fill = pos)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 4) +
  theme_classic() +
  facet_wrap(~stat, scales = "free")

```

There are some outliers here for sure but lets roll with the data as is.

Before we model with 5 clusters (the same amount of positions on an NBA team) Lets look at the position counts as it stands today.

```{r echo=FALSE}
sdf %>% 
  group_by(pos) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n, pos, fill = pos)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_classic()
```

```{r five_model, echo=FALSE}
five_model <- df %>% 
  select(-player) %>% 
  kmeans(centers = 5)
# summary(five_model)

tidy(five_model) %>% print()
```

Let's take a look at the amount of players in each of the different clusters.

```{r echo=FALSE}
df$clus_5 <- five_model$cluster
df$clus_5 <- df$clus_5 %>% as.character()

df %>% 
  group_by(clus_5) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n, clus_5, fill = clus_5)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_classic()

df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(pts, ast, color = clus_5)) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_classic()

  
```

Now let's take a looks at how each cluster stacks up against each other for every stat.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# df %>% 
#   group_by(clus_5) %>%
#   pivot_longer(where(is.numeric)) %>% 
#   ggplot(aes(value, fill = clus_5)) +
#   geom_density() +
#   theme_classic() +
#   facet_wrap(vars(clus_5, name), ncol = 1)

for (col in colnames(df[,2:20])) {
  # print(col)
  df$Y <- df[col] %>% unlist()
  gg_tmp <- df %>% 
    ggplot(aes(Y, fill = clus_5)) +
    geom_density() +
    theme_classic() +
    xlab(col)
  print(gg_tmp)
}
df %>% select(-Y)
```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
pct <- function(x){
  x/sum(x)
}
 
df %>%
  select(-c(pos_C:pos_SG, Y)) %>% 
  group_by(clus_5) %>%
  summarise_if(is.numeric, sum) %>% 
  summarise_if(is.numeric, pct) %>% 
  round(2) |> 
  kable(booktabs = TRUE) |> 
  kable_styling(font_size = 8)



```


So it looks like our model has separated the players on skill. We'll notice that the

- Red group (1) are the top players.  
- Pink group (5) are the next best players
- Yellow group (2) are likely role players 
- Green group (3) are the lower tier players
- Blue group (4) are likely young players and lower tier palyers.

Now that I've made the claim let me try and back it up.

### Blue Group - 4

```{r}
df |> 
  filter(clus_5 == "5") |> 
  summarise(
    centers = sum(pos_C),
    power_forwards = sum(pos_PF),
    small_forwards = sum(pos_SF),
    shooting_guards = sum(pos_SG),
    point_guards = sum(pos_PG)
  ) |> 
  kable(booktabs = TRUE) |> 
  kable_styling(font_size = 8)

```
A lot of shooting guards in this group but then again there are more shooting guards in the league than anything else as we saw above.

I called this group either 1 of 2 things.  Lower Tier players or younger players. So let's take a look at the general ages of the players. 
```{r echo=FALSE}
df |> 
  ggplot(aes(clus_5, age, fill = clus_5)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_classic()

df |> 
  group_by(clus_5) |> 
  select(age) |> 
  summarise(
    average_age = round(mean(age), 2),
    oldest = max(age),
    youngest = min(age),
    median_age = median(age)
  ) |> 
  kable(booktabs = TRUE) |> 
  kable_styling(font_size = 8)

df |> 
  ggplot(aes(age, fill = clus_5)) +
  geom_density() +
  facet_wrap(~clus_5, ncol = 1) +
  theme_classic() 

```

So I think we can see that the Blue group is the youngest of the 5 groups.  So now let's see the minutes played and games started from each of groups.  We expect the Pink group to have noticeably less than the other groups.

```{r echo=FALSE}
df |> 
  ggplot(aes(clus_5, mp, fill = clus_5)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 4 ) +
  theme_classic()

```

Bingo looks like we got quite a few end of the bench guys.  
They're also averaging less than a start and only have `r sum(subset(df, clus_5 == '5')$gs)` starts between them.  

```{r echo=FALSE}
df |> 
  group_by(clus_5) |> 
  summarise(
    mean_starts = round(mean(gs), 2),
    total_starts = sum(gs)
  ) 


```


So who are some the players in Group 4?

```{r echo=FALSE}
rbind(
df |> 
  filter(clus_5 == 5) |> 
  slice_max(age, n = 1) |> 
  mutate( Fact = "Oldest", reb = orb+drb),                                 

df |> 
  filter(clus_5 == 5) |> 
  slice_min(age, n = 1) |> 
  mutate( Fact = "Youngest", reb = orb+drb),

df |> 
  filter(clus_5 == 5) |> 
  slice_max(pts, n = 1) |> 
  mutate( Fact = "Top Scorer", reb = orb+drb),

df |> 
  filter(clus_5 == 5) |> 
  slice_max(ast, n = 1) |> 
  mutate( Fact = "Assist Leader", reb = orb+drb),

df |> 
  filter(clus_5 == 5) |> 
  slice_max(orb+drb, n = 1) |> 
  mutate( Fact = "Most Rebounds", reb = orb+drb),

df |> 
  filter(clus_5 == 5) |> 
  slice_max(stl, n = 1) |> 
  mutate( Fact = "Most Steals", reb = orb+drb),

df |> 
  filter(clus_5 == 5) |> 
  slice_max(blk, n = 1) |> 
  mutate( Fact = "Most Blocks", reb = orb+drb)
) |> 
  select(
    player,
    Fact,
    age, pts, ast, reb, stl, blk
  ) |> 
  arrange(Fact) |> 
  kable(booktabs = TRUE) |> 
  kable_styling(font_size = 8)

```
### Red group - 1

I said that these players are the cream of the crop. We've already seen the stats by cluster in the anlysis above so let's approach this a different way.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}

df |> 
  pivot_longer(pos_C:pos_SG) |>
  filter(value == 1) |>
  group_by(name) |>
  slice_max(mp, n = 1) |> 
  select(player, name, mp, clus_5) |> 
  kable(booktabs = TRUE) |> 
  kable_styling(font_size = 8)

```

So we can see that Red Group 1 has the most players with the top minutes played by a position.  It is however interesting that there are 2 Pink group-5 members making there way onto the list.  This tells me our model may not value big men enough.

Lets check in on the rebound leaders and there cluster grouping.

```{r echo=FALSE}
df |> 
  pivot_longer(pos_C:pos_SG) |> 
  filter(value == 1) |> 
  mutate(trb = orb + drb) |> 
  group_by(name) |> 
  slice_max(trb, n=5) |> 
  select(-c(Y, value)) |> 
  arrange(desc(orb+ drb)) |> 
  arrange(name) |>
  kable(booktabs = TRUE) |> 
  kable_styling(font_size = 8) |> 
  column_spec(14, color = "grey", bold = T, border_left = T, border_right = T) |> 
  column_spec(15, color = "grey", bold = T, border_right = T) 

```

let's keep looking at this one.  We can filter out anyone who is not a top 5 player in at least 1 category.  Lets see how this shakes out. 

```{r echo=FALSE}

z <- function(x) {
  rank(desc(x))
}


tmp <- df |>
  pivot_longer(pos_C:pos_SG) |>
  filter(value == 1) |>
  select(c(player, mp:pts, name)) |>
  mutate_if(is.numeric, z) |>
  arrange(mp) |>
  mutate_if(is.numeric, floor) |>
  mutate(pos = name) |>
  select(-name) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = mp:pts) |>
  filter(value <= 5)

df |>
  filter(player %in% tmp$player) |>
  select(player, mp:pts, clus_5) |> 
  group_by(clus_5) |> 
  summarise(n = n()) |> 
  ggplot(aes(n, clus_5, fill = clus_5)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_classic()
  
# 
# tmp |>
#   kable(booktabs = TRUE) |>
#   kable_styling(font_size = 8)
# 
# df |>
#   filter(player %in% tmp$player) |>
#   select(mp:pts, clus_5) |>
#   kable(booktabs = TRUE) |>
#   kable_styling(font_size = 8)

  # group_by(name)
  # mutate_at(c(mp:fg), )
```

Notice that there are no group 4 people on the list.

As a reminder this is the break down of all players by cluster 

```{r echo=FALSE}

df |>
  select(player, mp:pts, clus_5) |> 
  group_by(clus_5) |> 
  summarise(n = n()) |> 
  ggplot(aes(n, clus_5, fill = clus_5)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_classic()
```

So the amount of cluster 1 folks leading the lead is telling.
